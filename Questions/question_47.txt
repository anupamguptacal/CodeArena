Write a Program to accept a square 2-D array and find the mirror image of the array if the mirror is placed on the left diagonal. Imagine placing a mirror on the left diagonal (on a graph, a left diagonal would be the line from (0,4)) to (4,0) with slope -1) and print the array created due to this left diagonal mirror. You can either create a new array for this purpose or do this just by changing the original array or just by printing using loops in a clever way. You can also do this recursively for a great exercise!
