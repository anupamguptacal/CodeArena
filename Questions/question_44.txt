Write a Program to accept a 2-D array with odd number of rows and flip the array on it's stomach i.e. the first row becomes the last row, the second-row becomes the second-last row etc. Create a new array with this format and print it. The output is just the printed final created matrix but do this by creating the flipped matrix (as a new 2-D array) not just by printing using loops in a clever way. You can also do this recursively, as a fun exercise!

Input: [[3,4,6],[0,0,0],[4,1,6],[1,1,1],[15,32,6]] (each individual array represents a row of the 2-D matrix)
Output: [[15,32,6],[1,1,1],[4,1,6],[0,0,0],[3,4,6]]

Input: [[7,8,9],[0,0,0],[1,1,1]] (each individual array represents a row of the 2-D matrix)
Output: [[1,1,1],[0,0,0],[7,8,9]]
